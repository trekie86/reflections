Git will just setup the repo but nothing will be in it yet.

It gives you a chance to group your commits.

You can use the staging area and git diff --staged to ensure you only have one logic change before you commit.

Anytime I want to keep my official branch clean or test out new features.

It helps you better see the history of changes.

The result is the content of all of the branches put together as a single new commit. It is represented that way because those changes were on their own branch and then combined, they were not checked in on master.

Automatic merges are faster but introduce bugs.

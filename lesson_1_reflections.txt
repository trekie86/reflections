It made finding the bug easier.

It allows you to find things that used to work and then didn't. It just allows you to see the development of a file.

The ones that combine files into a single commit are designed to handle logical changes, this that are interrelated. Google docs is a document application, it's not common for multiple documents to be related.

I can use git log to see the history of all of the commits with their titles. I can use git diff to compare the changes, or to actually see the changes that occurred in a specific commit.

It makes you more confident because there is always a way to go back as well as an easier mechanism to find bugs.
